<p>Note: Skip to <strong>Step 5</strong> if you want the “quick fix”.</p>
<p>I will briefly document how I setup RStudio server on an Amazon AWS cloud instance. Once you have an AWS account you should be able to follow these instructions to set everything up. I suggest you follow some tutorial such as <a href="https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html">here</a> in order to setup the Amazon ec2 instance, it’s not difficult but it is a separate topic. I am using the <em>“Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type”</em> on a <em>“free eligible tier t2.micro”</em> - The free version has 1GB of memory which is fine for getting to know the environment/Amazon AWS but I strongly recomend investing in a paid instance once your are familiar.</p>
<p>Once the instance is setup, you might want to follow these instructions <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html">here</a> to set up PuTTY (for Windows users) and obtain a .pem key. Once we are logged into PuTTY we can run the following commands into the terminal:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install R</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y r-base r-base-dev</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download and isntall RStudio</p>
<p>Find the latest RStudio version link from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a> and replace the link below after the <code>wget</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install gdebi-core
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/bionic/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.1335-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.2.1335-amd64.deb</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> We can add a user to the system to log into RStudio server</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod 777 -R /usr/local/lib/R/site-library
sudo adduser YOURUSERNAME</code></pre>
<p>That should be it. I was using this code a little while back. I will update the post when I install an AWS instance again in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Updating R to later versions</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Quick version</p>
<p>You can install RStudio directly as an Amazon AWS instance by using Louis Aslett’s RStudio Amazon Machine Image (AMI) <a href="http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/">here</a>. There is also a short video <a href="http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/video_guide.html">here</a> on how you can set it up painlessly!</p>
<p>I recommend Louis Aslett’s AMI especially if you are not familiar with Bash or Shell commands however I was running into some compatibility problems with package versions and R versions which is why I sought a way to manually install R and have full control.</p>
<p>Below are a few additional commands, mostly for myself since I kept all these commands in a notepad and there was a reason they were kept!</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Upgrade R</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y r-base r-recommended r-base-dev</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change password for the root user</p>
<pre><code>sudo passwd root
su root</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Additional</p>
<pre><code>apt-get -y build-dep libcurl4-gnutls-dev</code></pre>
